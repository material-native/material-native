Fundamental and higher level components implementing [Material Design][md] for [React Native][rn].

## Installation

1. Follow the installation instructions for the [react-native-vector-icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons#installation) library.
2. Run: `npm i material-native --save`

## Getting Started

## Running the MaterialExplorer example
### Android
You may need to open `material-native/examples/MaterialExplorer/android` in Android Studio first or setup `ANDROID_HOME` for react-native to find the Android SDK.

```shell
cd material-native/examples/MaterialExplorer
npm install
npm start

# In a separate terminal tab:
npm run explorer-android
```

### iOS
You can also run `ios/MaterialExplorer.xcodeproj` in XCode in place of `npm run explorer-ios`.

```shell
cd material-native
npm install
npm start

# In a separate terminal tab:
npm run explorer-ios
```

## About
This project is developed based on the unmaintained [react-native-material-design][] and [react-native-material-kit][] libraries. The goal being to replace the two libraries with one library implementing all components supported by either library, merge the two communities into one, implement core features that both libraries are missing, and fix some persistent of the bugs in each library.

Much of the new foundation and merge work was done at [Redwerks](http://redwerks.org/).
